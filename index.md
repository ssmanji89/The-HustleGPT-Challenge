The HustleGPT Challenge is primarily about building a business with the help of ChatGPT or GPT-4. Some folks are letting HustleGPT take the wheel and make all of the executive decisions while others or treating Hustle GPT as a co-founder with which they can discuss business decisions. Regardless of which route you take, its important to be aware up front that this is still a lot of work!

## Research and identify popular items with high demand on online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, or Etsy. Look for items that have a low cost of goods sold and a high profit margin.
## Purchase a small quantity of the identified items using the $100 budget. Look for deals, discounts, and coupons to stretch the budget even further.
## Create a store on a popular online marketplace or social media platform such as Instagram or Facebook, and list the purchased items for sale at a higher price than the cost of goods sold.
## Use targeted ads on social media platforms to reach potential customers and drive traffic to the store.
## When sales start coming in, use the profits to reinvest in more inventory of the popular items with high demand, and continue to scale up the business.
## Explore other opportunities to expand the business such as offering bundle deals, creating a subscription service, or partnering with other businesses to offer complementary products.
